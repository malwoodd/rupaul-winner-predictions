# ‚ú® Category is... Machine learning predictions ‚ú® 

If you haven't already taken a peak at my personal README, I'm a Data newbie and you've just stumbled upon my first project! Thanks for coming along for the ride, it's gonna be a fun one. Warning: I *love* gifs & RuPaul references.

<br>

## This week's maxi challange..
*(The Project)*

This project aims to predict the outcome of a season of Rupaul's Drag Race, ***and*** RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars. We will be writing in Python üêç , and using three different machine learning algorithms to make said predictions. Stay tuned as we navigate through ML for our very first time!

Not sure what Drag Race is? [Feel free to read about it here](https://rupaulsdragrace.fandom.com/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race). TLDR: Drag Race is a reality competition TV series on the search for "America's Next Drag Superstar", and All Stars is the sister series which showcases past contestants from Drag Race competing for a spot in the Drag Race Hall of Fame.

For months/weeks I was stumped for a project idea. Finally, when my younger brother came to visit me for Christmas we decided it was time to collaborate! I also want to give a special shoutout to my friend Mike who introduced me to this [lovely API](https://drag-race-api.readme.io/docs) that sparked the entire project.

All I knew was that I wanted it to be a topic I had at least *some* interest in, so when this sick'ning (aka incredible) API loaded before my eyes I thought to myself...

**Coming Soon**

1. Regular Seasons

2. All Stars Seasons

## How to run my project locally

At the top of each .py file you'll see a link to Google colab where we originally wrote & tested all of our code. Copy that link and feel free to ask any questions if needed. It will look something like this:

```
Automatically generated by Colaboratory.
Original file is located at
    https://colab.research.google.com/drive/XXXXXXXXXX
```

Each of these files were written with a specific objective (i.e. getting Queen biography data, challenge data), and produced a CSV which will also be uploaded within a specific folder for review (to be created). Some external data has been used to supplement these CSV files with data that was not present in the API. All external sources will be referenced below.

I know this file is ridled with drag jargon so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask! I tried to keep it pretty easy to follow along, but I also wanted to ensure I had ‚ú® fun ‚ú® and stayed true to myself. If you've made it this far, thank you. If you have any feedback, or just want to ki ki, please reach out!
