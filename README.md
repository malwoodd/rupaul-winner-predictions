## What you need to know about RuPaul

So what or who in the world is RuPaul? RuPaul Andre Charles, known simply as as RuPaul, is an American drag queen, actor, model, singer, television personality, and author. Most importantly - **iconic**. Bless RuPaul for creating Rupaul's Drag Race, arguably the best reality TV there is, and the topic of this project.

RuPaul's Drag Race is an American reality competition television series in search of "America's next drag superstar." RuPaul plays the role of host, mentor, and head judge for this series, as contestants are given different challenges each week.

RuPaul's Drag Race *All Stars* is an All Star spin-off of RuPaul's Drag Race. These seasons feature returning queens from previous seasons for a chance to be inducted into the "Drag Race Hall of Fame".

## The motivation behind this project

For months/weeks I was stumped for a project idea. Finally, when my younger brother came to visit me for Christmas we decided it was time to collaborate! I also want to give a special shoutout to my friend Mike who introduced me to this [lovely API](https://drag-race-api.readme.io/docs) that sparked the entire project.

All I knew was that I wanted it to be a topic I had at least *some* interest in, so when this sick'ning (aka incredible) API loaded before my eyes I thought to myself...

I know this file is ridled with RuPaul phrases so if you have any questions, please feel free to ask! I tried to keep it pretty easy to follow along, but I also wanted to ensure I had ✨ fun ✨ and stayed true to myself. If you've made it this far, thank you. If you have any feedback, or just want to ki ki, please reach out!
